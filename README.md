The basis of this project is an online tutorial that I have re-purposed and expanded upon. 

The aim is to train an ML engine on a set of Championship football data to make match predictions, evaluate the accuracy and then improve the model.

Through doing this I learnt more about tools such as pandas, numpy, sklearn; and concepts such as web scraping, data analysis, model training and prediction.
